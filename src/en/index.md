## We Want a Better EU

We are european citicens and we believe in the EU, but that does not mean we are completely satisfied with how things are. We want a better EU...

### A democratic EU

The EU does not have a truly elected government, and the Parliament - the only institution elected directly by the people - does not have enough power. We need a true EU government that the people of the EU can identify with. And we need more democratic processes.

### An effective EU

During the debate about the EU constitution, the refugee crisis and on other occasions, we saw that the EU is not very effective in making desisions. Sometimes it is even trapped in a complete deadlock, because countries block every decision with a veto. We need an EU that can react and do the right thing quickly!

### A social EU

Prosperity, freedom and peace for everybody - That's what we expect the EU to give us, not just free trade or cheap roaming. We think that the EU should align it's efforts around those benefits, and communicate better that many of it's policies actually give us those.

### A green EU

We have to become even better at not destroying our planet. We want the EU to put even more focus on the environment and on sustainability. This will make the EU more livable, create jobs, and ensure that we leave the world in a condition where our children and grandchildren can live well and prosper.

The EU is great, but we think it must become even better. Join our movement to show everyone that you want a better EU, and so we can reach out to you when we start any projects for making the EU better.

## We Want to be Global Leaders

Right now, the EU often seems to be stuck while others make global politics. We want this to change - We want to be world leaders. Not by using force, but leading by example.

### Towards a Peaceful Future

The EU is a peace project. It stands for the longest period of peace that europe has ever seen. It has to continue this path, and it has to take measures to bring peace to the whole world.

### Towards a Sustainable Future

The way we treat our planet right now is not sustainable. The EU can - and **must** - ensure that we increase renewable enery and reduce carbon dioxide emissions, toxines and non-recyclable waste.

### Towards a Prosper Future

Peace and a working, healthy society can only happen when there is social justice and everyone can live a prosper, healthy live. We have to ensure that everybody gets a fair chance, not only the rich.

The EU has to grow up. It has to see itself as a global super-power, not just a loose connection of nation states. But not a super power that threatens to invade or destroy others - A super power that is a global leader towards a better future for **everybody on this planet**.

## In a Global Economy...

Globalization will not stop. And this is a good thing - The world will move closer together, and it will ultimately become a better place. But we have to find - and constantly redefine - our place in this globalized world.

### We Have to Move Closer Together

When we only cater to the interests of local communities and nations states, we will have no chance in a globalized world. When we raise fences at our borders and close down our economies, only the rest of the world will profit. When we work together, Europe can be a global player!

### We Have to Stand our Ground

We cannot lower our standards. We have to fight for democracy, human rights and freedom of the press - within the EU and in our neighboring countries. We have to speak up when we see injustice. This also means that we have to become much better at handling the humanitarian crisis that are happening now, at our doorstep.

### We Have to Fight for Justice

When there is something wrong, we must fix it. Right now, the EU is moving too slowly. It is even often stuck in a dead-lock. This has to change. Europe has to do even more to fight for human rights, freedom and justice.

Together, we can lobby politicians to break the deadlocks, to make the EU better and more effective. Not as a group of wealthy, shady lobbyists, but as a grass-roots movement of Europeans who care for their continent.

## We Want the Four Freedoms

Protectionist politicians want to cut down on the four freedoms the EU guarantees to everyone of us. They say that those freedoms destroy jobs and support criminals. But the opposite is true: Those freedoms create a level playing field: Everyone of us has the same chances, no matter where in the EU they come from!

### Free Movement of People

The EU gives us the freedom to live, work and study everywhere. We can move to another country, stay for some time, then move on. Sure, at one point, most people want to settle down somewhere. But if you're young, travel the EU. It's awesome.

### Free Movement of Goods

Every business in the EU can deliver goods to all member countries. We can buy things from 1000 km away just as easily as from around the corner. This is a huge opportunity for customers **and** for businesses - even small businesses.

### Free Movement of Services

Just as with goods, every business can deliver their services everywhere in the EU. Because of this, you can now run small, niche businesses in countries where it would not have been possible some years ago - Because you would not have had the customers needed.

### Free Movement of Capital

Transferring money across the EU has become so easy and so cheap that it is even hard to remember how that worked before the Euro and before the Single European Payment Area (SEPA). There is less hassle for businesses and customers, which means more value and more jobs.

Sure, we have to avoid a race to the bottom. We have to avoid lowering income levels as a result of cheap labour that exists somewhere else in the EU. But this does not mean we have to give up our freedoms. Instead we have to create a race to the top!

## We Don't Have All the Answers

Yes, there are a lot of things that we have to improve or fix in the EU. There are tough problems we are facing. And no, we don't have answers to most of them.

But that's exactly why we need this community - To bring together a group of people who want to see the EU succeed, and who want to contribute to that success.

Sign this statement to become a part of that community. Sign this statement to become a part of the solution!

## FAQ

#### Why are you doing this?

The rist of EU skepticism, anti-EU politics, and especially the brexit, scare us. We believe that we need the EU, and we identify ourselfes as European citicens.

We want to gather a community of like-minded people. First, we want to gather a large Twitter following, so we can reach everyone who is interested in helping to build a stronger, more democratic, better EU.

#### Are you affiliated with a party or the EU government?

No, we want this to become a true grass roots movement, with a diverse set of followers.

#### Do I have to follow you on Twitter to sign the statement?

Technically, no. You can just tweet [this message](TODO), and we will register you as supporter. But **please follow us on Twitter** too, since our idea is to create a **community** that we can reach out to.

#### Can I sign this statement when I am not from the EU?

Yes, we want to gather a community of EU supporters. It does not matter to us where you live or where you are from.

#### If I sign this statement, does that mean I don't want to be a citizen of my country anymore?

No. It just means that you **also** identify as a European citicen.

#### What is your plan?

Right now, we are trying to gather people who want to see the EU succeed, and who want to contribute to that success. After the initial phase of gathering people, we want to start projects to improve the EU and the life of europeans. For this, we will need money and volunteers, later.
