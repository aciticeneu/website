# Mission

<section class="main">

We want to gather a community of pro-EU citizens arount this website and its Twitter and Facebook presence. Together with them, we want to start projects and actions that aim to improve life and politics in the EU.

* Whenever possible, we will keep our messaging and actions positive.
* We aim to be a diverse group of open-minded people. We want to lead by example, not force our views on others.
* As a community we neither endorse nor fight any political party. We aim to gather followers with many different political points of view.
* We define ourselfs by what we are fighting for, not what we are fighting against.
* We are not a political party, and we do not aspire to be one.
